It's me, Aarussssssssssssshhhhhhhh! I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for being such a huge part of making this farewell event amazing. 
You've put in so much effort and hard work, and honestly, I have nothing but respect for you. I'm making this because,I been vetti fr ðŸ’€
but also because I wanted to show appreciation for everything you've done!

First off, you made an absolutely professional-looking registration form on Google Forms. If I didnâ€™t know you personally, 
I would have never guessed it was made by you! You put in a ton of effort cross-checking all the details and even created 
a whole Excel spreadsheet to track everything.

And the return gifts? Absolute GOATED FR. Premium, customized, and even a thank-you card with a short, meaningful, and memorable message. 
You even traveled far just to get them! Thatâ€™s some next-level dedication.

You spent so much time on this event, even sacrificing the time you could have spent drawingâ€”something you really love doing. 
That alone shows how much you cared about making this farewell special for everyone.

Without your dedication and hard work, this farewell wouldnâ€™t have been as incredible as it was. 

This website is just a small token of appreciation for everything youâ€™ve done. You really made this event something unforgettable. 

Arigato Sam :).`;
